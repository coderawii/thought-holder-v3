// v-enter: Starting state for enter. Added before element is inserted, removed one frame after element is inserted.

// v-enter-active: Active state for enter. Applied during the entire entering phase. Added before element is inserted, removed when transition/animation finishes. This class can be used to define the duration, delay and easing curve for the entering transition.

// v-enter-to: Only available in versions 2.1.8+. Ending state for enter. Added one frame after element is inserted (at the same time v-enter is removed), removed when transition/animation finishes.

// v-leave: Starting state for leave. Added immediately when a leaving transition is triggered, removed after one frame.

// v-leave-active: Active state for leave. Applied during the entire leaving phase. Added immediately when leave transition is triggered, removed when the transition/animation finishes. This class can be used to define the duration, delay and easing curve for the leaving transition.

// v-leave-to: Only available in versions 2.1.8+. Ending state for leave. Added one frame after a leaving transition is triggered (at the same time v-leave is removed), removed when the transition/animation finishes.


// Each of these classes will be prefixed with the name of the transition. Here the v- prefix is the default when you use a <transition> element with no name. If you use <transition name="my-transition"> for example, then the v-enter class would instead be my-transition-enter.

// v-enter-active and v-leave-active give you the ability to specify different easing curves for enter/leave transitions, which youâ€™ll see an example of in the following section.
